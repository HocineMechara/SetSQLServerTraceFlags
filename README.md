# SetSQLServerTraceFlags
This PowerShell function sets one or more SQL Server trace flags across multiple remote servers. It uses provided credentials to access each server, identifies all SQL Server instances, and ensures the specified trace flags are added to the appropriate registry keys. If the trace flags are not already present, they are added, and optionally, the corresponding SQL instance is restarted based on user input. The function requires four parameters: a restart flag (Y or N), a list of trace flags, target server names, and a valid credential object. It provides feedback on whether each trace flag was newly set or already present, and logs restart actions where applicable.
